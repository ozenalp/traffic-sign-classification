# German Traffic Sign Recognition using TensorFlow

## Description

***This repository contains a project for a class at MEF University.*** The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model for recognizing German traffic signs using TensorFlow, an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark" dataset, obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign). This dataset has more than 50,000 images of 43 different traffic signs.

Detailed information about the dataset can be found [here](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_dataset.html)

## Requirements

The main requirements for this project are:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
- Other dependencies (numpy, pandas, etc.)

## References

This project makes use of the "GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark" dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign). 

The implementation is based on the following paper: [Multi-column Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6033395).
